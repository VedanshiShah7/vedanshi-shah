            <div class="abstract">Although visualizations for communication are some of our earliest examples of visualization and the recent re-emergence of interest in this area by academic researchers, there are no unifying theories or guidelines specific to visualizations for communication. Instead, most visualizations for communication are built as point solutions to a specific problem. To address this gap, this research project will build a design space specifically for visualization for communication. Such a space will provide quick and actionable guidance to designers as they consider how to build new visualizations for communication tools.</div>

            <div class="abstract">We are performing gauge equivariance focusing on developing an attention layer instead of a convolutional layer to develop the mesh messaging of neural networks. We are focusing on the extension to create message passing, starting with running baselines and considering scoring the dataset. Finally, working on clearly improving the accuracy by focusing on harder datasets, problems and a variety of settings.</div>

            <div class="research-date">January 2022</div>
            <div class="abstract">Wordle is a popular daily word-guessing game that has become a viral sensation for its simple premise of guessing a five letter word in six attempts. Despite its solo-style play, it has fostered a competitive community. The game provides individual scores but lacks overall game-wide statistics, so trends like overall performance and relative difficulty are not available. Our project aims to make these analyses possible in a visualization that not only captures data about the players, but also the game itself.</div>
